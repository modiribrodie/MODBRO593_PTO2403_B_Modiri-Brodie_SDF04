# [SDF04] CSS Magic Buttons

The task that i have completed was making buttons more appealing and interactive. I have chosen to customize the buttons with beautiful color combinations. My design choice was to make the colors to transition/change when hovering over each button. The animation style i chose on Button 2 and 3 allows the color to glide into the next, creating a scroll-like look.
